# ISETicket

ISETicket is a simple ticketing system for small events built on the Sepolia Web3 network. It is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to buy and return tickets for events. Doormen and security personnel can also use the dApp to verify the authenticity of tickets. The Venue can also use the dApp to create events and manage ticket sales.
